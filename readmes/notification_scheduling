Notification scheduling:
1) Admin creates a new notification template through the web UI, containing title, body, scheduledFor
2) A bg-timer checks for notification_templates that have not been sent and whos scheuledFor has passed.
2.2) For each found notification, update 'sentAt' and pass them to a serial message queue
2.3) For each message in the serial message queue, divide the receivers into batches of 1000 and send each serially
2.4) Attempt to send each batch a maximum of 5 times (honor retry-after by implementing exponential-backoff)
2.5) Upon receiving response, persist a 'notification' object, tied to the 'notification_template', and to the receiving 'device'. 
2.6) If any errors occurred during any batch, the notification_template status will be error (even if some batches were successful)

The 'notification' object also contains status, (TODO: add send timestamp?).

When parsing the response: 
- remove invalid tokens 
- update old tokens if we receive new
