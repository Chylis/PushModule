Notification scheduling:
1) Admin creates a new notification template through the web UI, containing title, body, scheduledFor
2) A bg-timer checks for notification_templates that have not been sent and whos scheuledFor has passed.
2.2) For each found notification, update 'sentAt' and send them.
2.3) Upon receiving response, persist a 'notification' object, tied to the 'notification_template', and to the receiving 'device'. 
The 'notification' object also contains status, (TODO: add send timestamp?).

When parsing the response: 
- mark invalid tokens as removed
- update old tokens if we receive new
